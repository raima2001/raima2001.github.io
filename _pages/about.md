I am Raima Islam, master's student at Harvard University studying Computational Science and Engineering. I am focused on healthcare research, specifically in lung cancer, applying graphical machine learning  methods to find novel cell interactions and understanding explainable regulatory behavior of cancer subtypes at single-cell resolution and currently doing my thesis with Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health under Dr. John Quackenbush. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science from BRAC University. During that time, I held both industrial and research internships focusing on machine learning. I have published papers in top-tier venues such as ICLR, Nature, WSDM, CHI, COLING, ACCV, etc. encompassing domains such as NLP, computer vision, bioinformatics and Human-Computer Interaction.
